# FollowTheTurtle

## Purpose
The purpose behind this project was to utilize a solid understanding of the Robot Operating System (ROS) 2 framework and build nodes, servers and design various messages/packets of information between create a simulation that can be applied towards robotic hardware. FollowTheTurtle serves to use the ROS2 framework to build a simulation of a bait-catch approach where the turtlesim (simulated robot) will be automatically controlled via information between nodes and servers to guide itself towards spawned turtles as a target. Targets are spawned at a particular frequency in the displayed window and will be killed/removed once caught by the turtlesim. FollowTheTurtle can be built upon in the future to recognize targets via robotic hardware using Lidar.
